My name is Kaiyu Li, a PhD student in Statistics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I am supervised by [Prof. Serge Guillas](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucaksgu/) and [Prof. F-X Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io). 

<!-- My research is funded by the Lloyd’s Tercentenary Research Foundation, the Lighthill Risk Network and the Lloyd’s Register Foundation-Data Centric Engineering Programme of the Alan Turing Institute for the project “Future Indonesian Tsunamis: Towards End-to-end Risk quantification (FITTER)”. -->

## Research Interest
I am interested in uncertainty quantification, computational statistics and machine learning.  My work involves developing and applying new methods to investigate and quantify uncertainties in computer models.
