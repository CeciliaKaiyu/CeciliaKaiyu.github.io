My name is Kaiyu Li, a PhD student in Statistics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I am supervised by [Prof. Serge Guillas](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucaksgu/) and [Prof. F-X Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io). Before that, I accomplished my M.Sc in Applied Statistics at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk). 

Research Interest
======
Overall, I am interested in uncertainty quantification, computational statistics and machine learning. 

- My work involves developing and applying new methods to investigate and quantify uncertainties in computer models.

- Monte Carlo methods.
